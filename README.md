# Alphabet
Hey Guys , so Alphabet is basically a alphabet tutor which points out the mistake where the child is going wrong .

How does it work??

Writing Module :
First it will show you an animation of how to write a letter lets say A then you will write it and scan it now it will detect where are you deviating from the actual A.

Pronunciation module:
Alphabet will pronounce A , then you are asked to pronounce a suppose you pronounce A ( with a little of ee in end as in Ae) it will prompt you are saying an e extra . 
This will go on until you hit the right spot i mean you pronounce it correctly .
